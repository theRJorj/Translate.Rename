# Translate.Rename
Bulk file rename app

this app is my first project on Github.
it is a bulk file rename/translator.
it is based on python.
only tested on windows 10 64bit.
the GUI is based on qt.

the app name is Translate.Rename and it is capable of:
1. translates all the files into a folder and renames'em. (uses Built-in google translate API).
2. adds any characters and dates to every file inside the selected folder. (both before or after original filename).
3. completely renames all files in a folder by user-given characters and adds _1,_2,...
4. change the suffixes of given files.
5. filters affected files by text, date, size, and type.

disclaimer: 
this is a beginner's experimental app. code may be messy.it uses google translate so do not expect very accurate translation.use suffix feature with extra caution.
I am not responsible for any damage to your files. use it at your own risk.
